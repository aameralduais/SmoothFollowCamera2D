Unity :: SmoothFollowCamera2D
==============

A follow camera with optional limits on horizontal and vertical positions to keep it within the viewable scene. Great for a 2D platformer.

This is a useable Unity project with:
* The main file: [Assets/Scripts/SmoothFollowCamera2D.cs](https://github.com/chrisgaunt/SmoothFollowCamera2D/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/SmoothFollowCamera2D.cs)
* Two demo scenes:
  * CameraWithoutLimits
  * CameraWithLimits

Made for use with [Unity](http://unity3d.com)
